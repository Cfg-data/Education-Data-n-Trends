    "    ## Analysis Considering the Country Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 1. Year\n",
    "    The dataset spans from 2005 to 2022, with a concentration of data points around the early 2010s (average year: 2012.96). Given the countries involved (mostly high-income countries), it is likely that most data points come from stable educational systems, reflecting steady trends in education policy over this time period.\n",
    "    The spread of years indicates that the dataset captures education-related trends during a relatively dynamic period, possibly influenced by events like the global financial crisis, which may have affected education budgets and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 2. Region/Country/Area\n",
    "    - **High-Income Countries:** Many of the countries in this dataset are high-income countries in Europe (e.g., Germany, France, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States) and advanced economies in Asia (e.g., Japan, Republic of Korea).\n",
    "    - **Data Gaps:** Several regions (such as Albania, Gibraltar, Montenegro, and Republic of Moldova) have fewer data points. This could indicate reporting challenges or differences in educational reporting standards in these countries.\n",
    "    - **High Reporting Frequency:** Countries like China (mainland and Hong Kong SAR), Russia, India, and United States appear more frequently, possibly reflecting a broader availability of data or more comprehensive educational statistics reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 3. All Staff Compensation as % of Total Expenditure in Public Institutions (%)\n",
    "    - **High Proportion in High-Income Countries:** The average percentage of staff compensation (50.77%) is likely to be high in more developed economies, where staff salaries are a substantial part of the education budget. Countries such as United States, United Kingdom, and Germany would likely have higher allocations toward staff compensation.\n",
    "    - **Wide Variation:** The minimum value of 0% suggests some countries or regions with very low educational staff compensation relative to total expenditure, possibly reflecting developing or conflict-affected areas (e.g., Albania, Republic of Moldova).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 4. Basic Access to Computers by Level of Education\n",
    "    - **Access Gap:** The statistics for computer access (mean access at lower secondary is 33.3%, primary 44.6%, and upper secondary 34.1%) highlight an issue of digital inequality. High-income countries like United States, Germany, and Australia likely have near-complete access to computers, whereas other countries like Albania, Moldova, or Gibraltar may lag behind.\n",
    "    - **Full Access vs. No Access:** The 25th percentile showing 0% access and the 75th percentile showing 100% access suggests a stark divide, with some regions offering complete access while others lack it entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 5. Capital Expenditure as % of Total Expenditure in Public Institutions (%)\n",
    "    - **Mean Capital Expenditure (6.09%):** This is relatively low, and suggests many countries are focusing more on current expenditure (e.g., staff salaries) than on long-term investments in infrastructure.\n",
    "    - **Developed Economies with Higher Capital Expenditure:** Countries like Germany, France, and United States may allocate more towards capital expenditure due to greater investment in educational infrastructure, whereas smaller or lower-income regions like Moldova or Albania may have lower capital expenditure allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 6. Current Expenditure Other Than Staff Compensation\n",
    "    - **Operational Costs:** With a mean of 17.08%, this represents a moderate share of expenditure going toward educational operations outside staff salaries. Developed economies like United States, Germany, and United Kingdom likely have higher operational costs, while regions with smaller or developing economies may allocate less toward this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 7. Gross Enrollment Ratios (GER) by Education Level\n",
    "    - **High GERs in Primary and Secondary Education:** Countries like United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France have near-universal enrollment, with GERs above 100% indicating education systems that accommodate students outside the typical age range.\n",
    "    - **Slight Gender Differences:** Although there is a slight gender imbalance in enrollment at lower secondary and primary levels (favoring boys), the upper secondary level exhibits near-gender parity or a slight advantage for girls, which is consistent with trends seen in many developed nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 8. Ratio of Girls to Boys in Education\n",
    "    - **Gender Parity:** The ratio of girls to boys is close to 1 across all education levels. At upper secondary, there is a slight shift toward more girls being enrolled, which could be attributed to improved access and opportunities for girls in many developed countries, like Sweden, Finland, and Norway.\n",
    "    - **Gender Imbalance in Some Regions:** Some countries with lower educational attainment or gender disparities may have ratios less favorable toward girls, particularly at lower secondary and primary levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 9. Teachers by Education Level\n",
    "    - **Disparities in Teacher Availability:** The large variation in teacher numbers, especially at lower and upper secondary levels, shows considerable disparities across regions. High-income countries like United States, Germany, and United Kingdom have more teachers in both primary and secondary education, while regions such as Albania, Moldova, or San Marino may have very low teacher counts or difficulty in data reporting.\n",
    "    - **Teacher Shortages:** The mean number of teachers at the lower secondary level (6.63) and upper secondary level (1.16) is low, with many countries having zero data points, suggesting teacher shortages or underreporting in specific regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 10. Teachers with Minimum Required Qualifications\n",
    "    - **Qualified Teacher Proportion:** The data indicates that only a small fraction of teachers in certain countries meet the minimum qualification standards, particularly in lower secondary and upper secondary education. This may point to issues in teacher training, especially in developing or under-resourced countries like Albania, Republic of Moldova, and Montenegro.\n",
    "    - **High Qualification Standards in Developed Countries:** Countries like Germany, United States, and Sweden are likely to have a higher percentage of teachers meeting qualification requirements, though even in these countries, some gaps may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Summary of Key Trends:\n",
    "    - **Digital Divide:** There is a significant gap in access to computers, especially at the lower secondary and upper secondary levels, highlighting a digital divide between high-income and low-income countries.\n",
    "    - **Investment in Education:** There is an apparent focus on current expenditures (e.g., staff salaries) rather than capital investments (e.g., infrastructure), with wide variations in spending priorities across regions.\n",
    "    - **Teacher Availability and Qualification:** Teacher shortages and qualification gaps are evident, particularly at the secondary education levels, reflecting systemic issues in teacher training and recruitment, especially in lower-income regions.\n",
    "    - **Gender Parity:** Generally, there is good gender parity in enrollment, though some countries show disparities, particularly at lower secondary and primary levels.\n",
    "    - **Geographical Inequality:** The dataset highlights stark disparities between countries, with developed countries like those in Europe, United States, and Japan consistently showing higher levels of investment, qualified teachers, and enrollment rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This detailed analysis suggests that education systems vary significantly across countries in terms of access to technology, teacher qualifications, expenditure priorities, and gender parity. High-income countries tend to have more stable educational systems, while low-income or smaller countries may face challenges in providing equal access to resources and qualified teachers.\n",

    "    ## Enrollment Ratio Trends Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Primary Education (Female and Male)\n",
    "    - **Trend**: Both primary female and male enrollment ratios have remained stable over the years, with a slight decline between 2005 and 2022.\n",
    "      - **Female**: From 102.66% in 2005 to 97.88% in 2022.\n",
    "      - **Male**: From 104% in 2005 to 98.36% in 2022.\n",
    "    - **Interpretation**: This indicates good access to primary education for both genders, with near-universal enrollment. The slight decline could reflect demographic or economic shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Lower Secondary Education (Female and Male)\n",
    "    - **Trend**: Enrollment in lower secondary education shows a slight decrease over time, particularly for females.\n",
    "      - **Female**: From 105.93% in 2005 to 88.23% in 2022.\n",
    "      - **Male**: From 105.51% in 2005 to 90.43% in 2022.\n",
    "    - **Interpretation**: The decline in enrollment may reflect challenges such as economic instability, educational policies, or shifts in enrollment priorities. Some countries might face difficulties due to infrastructure or economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Upper Secondary Education (Female and Male)\n",
    "    - **Trend**: Enrollment in upper secondary education shows significant variation.\n",
    "      - **Female**: From 98.26% in 2005 to a peak of 110% in 2015, followed by a drop to 92.07% in 2022.\n",
    "      - **Male**: From 93.61% in 2005 to 108.24% in 2015, followed by a decline to 93.64% in 2022.\n",
    "    - **Interpretation**: The sharp increase followed by a drop in upper secondary enrollment, especially for females, suggests possible shifts in access or economic factors influencing educational policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Gender Parity Trends\n",
    "    - **Primary Education**: Both male and female students exhibit near-equal enrollment rates, with only slight declines over time.\n",
    "    - **Secondary Education**: \n",
    "      - **Lower Secondary**: Both genders saw similar declines, but **female enrollment** experienced a slightly sharper drop than **male enrollment**.\n",
    "      - **Upper Secondary**: **Females** initially had higher GER but saw a decline after 2015, with **males** having slightly higher GER in 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Geographical Insights\n",
    "    - **High-Income Countries**: Countries like the **United States**, **Canada**, **Germany**, **France**, and the **United Kingdom** likely maintained strong enrollment rates across all levels.\n",
    "    - **Challenges in Lower-Income or Smaller Regions**: Countries such as **Albania**, **Republic of Moldova**, and **Montenegro** may experience challenges related to enrollment, particularly in secondary and upper-secondary education due to limited resources or political instability.\n",
    "    - **Global Trends**: The global trend from 2005 to 2022 indicates significant progress in primary education, but challenges persist at the secondary and upper-secondary levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Conclusion\n",
    "    - The data suggests near-universal primary education enrollment globally, but significant challenges remain in maintaining high enrollment at the secondary and upper-secondary levels.\n",
    "    - **Gender Parity**: While gender parity exists in primary and lower secondary education, females experienced a slight decline in upper secondary enrollment compared to males by 2022.\n",
    "    - **Regional Variations**: Developed countries show consistent high enrollment, while regions with lower resources or political challenges face difficulties in maintaining enrollment rates at the secondary education levels.\n",

    "    ### Interpretation of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Primary Level Teachers**:\n",
    "      - In **2005**, there were no teachers reported at the primary level.\n",
    "      - By **2010**, the number of primary-level teachers sharply increased to **48.38**.\n",
    "      - **2015** saw a reduction in primary-level teachers to **11.64**, with a subsequent rise to **55.42** in **2022**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Lower Secondary Level Teachers**:\n",
    "      - Similar to the primary level, there were no teachers at the lower secondary level in **2005**.\n",
    "      - The number of teachers increased by **2010** to **18.06**, but **2015** saw a dramatic drop to **0**.\n",
    "      - There was some recovery in **2022**, with **13.17** teachers reported at the lower secondary level.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Upper Secondary Level Teachers**:\n",
    "      - The trend for upper secondary teachers mirrored that of primary and lower secondary, with **no teachers** in **2005** and **2010**.\n",
    "      - **2022** marked the highest number of upper secondary teachers at **10.75**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Teachers with Minimum Required Qualifications**:\n",
    "      - The percentage of teachers with minimum required qualifications was generally high across all levels, but showed variability.\n",
    "      - **Primary Level**: Saw a fluctuation in qualifications from **18.80%** in **2005** to **52.17%** in **2022**.\n",
    "      - **Lower Secondary Level**: The percentage of teachers meeting the qualification standard ranged from **8.96%** in **2005** to **24.20%** in **2022**, reflecting a steady improvement.\n",
    "      - **Upper Secondary Level**: The qualification rate increased over time, from **9.10%** in **2005** to **32.92%** in **2022**, indicating improved teacher qualification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Key Observations:\n",
    "    1. **Sharp Increase in Teacher Numbers**: There was a sharp increase in teacher numbers in **2010** for primary and lower secondary levels, followed by a drop in **2015** and a recovery in **2022**.\n",
    "    2. **Teacher Qualification Improvement**: Over time, the percentage of teachers with minimum required qualifications increased across all education levels, especially at the primary and upper secondary levels.\n",
    "    3. **Fluctuating Trends**: The data suggests fluctuating trends, possibly due to changes in educational policies, economic factors, or disruptions affecting education systems during the interim years (2010-2021).\n",
    "    4. **Lack of Teachers in 2005 and 2010**: The lack of reported teachers in **2005** and **2010** at primary and lower secondary levels raises questions about either data reporting issues or temporary educational setbacks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This data highlights both progress in teacher qualifications and the instability in the number of teachers across various education levels over the years.\n",

    "    - The overall accuracy is 53%, which, while not exceptional, is an improvement over earlier attempts (35.71% with 50/50 split). The **MinMaxScaler** still outperforms the **StandardScaler**.\n",
    "    - The model needs further refinement, potentially through tuning hyperparameters or using more advanced techniques such as oversampling for imbalanced classes.\n",

    "    ### **Interpretation of Regressor Performance:**\n",
    "    - The **KNN Regressor** shows decent results with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 16.68, which suggests moderate prediction errors.\n",
    "    - The **R-Squared value of 0.34** indicates that the model explains about 34% of the variance in the data, which is modest. \n",
    "    - The **accuracy within a tolerance of 0.1** is low at 2.22%, meaning that the predictions are not closely aligned with the true values within this margin.\n",
    "    - These results imply that while the regressor is functioning reasonably well, it can likely benefit from improvements such as feature engineering or tuning the model's hyperparameters to reduce error further.\n",

    "    - The **best train-test split** for classification tasks is **70/30** with the **MinMaxScaler**, achieving the highest accuracy of **52.94%**.\n",
    "    - The **classification report** shows varying performance across different classes, with precision and recall issues, particularly for certain classes like 2015 and 2022.\n",
    "    - Further improvements can be made with better handling of class imbalances or tuning the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **KNN Regressor Results:**\n",
    "    - The **best train-test split** for regression tasks is **60/40** with the **StandardScaler**, achieving the lowest MSE of **16.68**.\n",
    "    - The **R-squared value** of **0.34** indicates that the model has a moderate ability to explain the variance, but there is room for improvement in predictive accuracy.\n",
    "    - The accuracy within a tolerance of 0.1 (2.22%) is very low, which suggests that further tuning and improvements are required for more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Final Recommendations:**\n",
    "    - For **classification** tasks, the **70/30 split** with **MinMaxScaler** is optimal, but further class imbalance handling may be necessary to improve recall and precision for underperforming classes.\n",
    "    - For **regression** tasks, the **60/40 split** with **StandardScaler** should be maintained, but more tuning is needed to reduce the error metrics and increase model accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "    ### KNN Classifier:\n",
    "    - **StandardScaler**: Accuracy is 14.71%, and the model struggles with most classes, particularly those with few instances. Some classes have perfect precision and recall, but these are rare and likely indicate overfitting.\n",
    "    - **MinMaxScaler**: Accuracy is reduced to 8.82%, indicating that MinMaxScaler does not improve the model's performance significantly. The model continues to underperform across most classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### KNN Regressor:\n",
    "    - **StandardScaler**: Shows moderate performance with a reasonable MSE of 16.68 and an R-squared of 0.34, but the accuracy within a tolerance of 0.1 is very low at 2.22%.\n",
    "    - **MinMaxScaler**: Performs slightly worse than StandardScaler, with a higher MSE of 17.93 and a lower R-squared of 0.29, suggesting that MinMaxScaler may not be suitable for this regression task.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Final Recommendations:\n",
    "    - **For Classification**: The KNN model struggles with both StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler. Data preprocessing, such as handling class imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning are recommended for improving performance.\n",
    "    - **For Regression**: The KNN Regressor with StandardScaler performs slightly better than with MinMaxScaler. Further model tuning and possibly exploring alternative regression models may help achieve better results.\n",
